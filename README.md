This app was created for 24 hours without sleep during the hackathon. The idea here was to make it work as fast as possible (and change the direction a couple of times as fast as possible). And yes, I know that code is shit sometimes, but it worked, and we took the prize place ;)

In short, it is an Android client for a platform where students can browse events, register for them, join interest groups (such as chess clubs or student bars), and subscribe to receive updates on relevant events.
